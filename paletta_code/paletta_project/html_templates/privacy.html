        <h1>1. Data Collection</h1>
        <p>We collect and store the following information to operate and improve the Paletta platform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic user data such as name, email address, and user role (e.g., teacher, student).</li>
          <li>Metadata related to uploaded files (e.g., upload time, file type, storage usage).</li>
          <li>Optional licensing data, including licensee details for publicly shared content.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h1>2. Consent and Releases</h1>
        <p>
          It is the responsibility of users to ensure that all individuals identifiable in uploaded content have signed appropriate release forms or have equivalent institutional permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paletta is developing tools that allow users to upload or link signed consent forms to specific files for improved record-keeping and compliance.
        </p>
      
        <h1>3. Use of AI Tools</h1>
        <p>Paletta may employ AI technologies to analyse and tag uploaded media to enhance search functions and user experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No biometric or facial recognition data is used unless explicitly permitted and legally justified.</li>
          <li>All AI-generated tags are used strictly for internal purposes and are never sold or shared with third parties.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h1>4. Data Storage and Security</h1>
        <p>We take data security seriously and implement the following measures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All user data and uploaded content are securely stored with role-based access control.</li>
          <li>Content is hosted on GDPR-compliant servers located in <em>[insert server region, e.g., the European Economic Area]</em>.</li>
          <li>We apply encryption, regular security audits, and strong access protocols to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorised access.</li>
        </ul>
